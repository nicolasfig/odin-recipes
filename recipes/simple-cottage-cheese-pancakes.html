    <p>
      These pancakes are an old favorite of mine. I use small-curd, low-fat
      cottage cheese. They come out thin and delicate, somewhere between a
      classic pancake and a crepe. A nice addition to a reduced-carb diet.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>

      <li>3 eggs</li>

      <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>

      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon butter, or as needed</li>

      <li>¼ cup blueberries, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Strain cottage cheese in a sieve fitted over a bowl, pressing down
        occasionally, until cottage cheese has dried out, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat eggs in a medium bowl; add cottage cheese, flour, melted butter,
        and salt. Mix until just blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat butter in a frying pan over medium-high heat; drop large spoonfuls
        of batter into the melted butter. Sprinkle blueberries into batter. Cook
        until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
      </li>
    </ol>
